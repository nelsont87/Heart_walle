Created Flask hosted local webpage that utilizes created Keras models to predict if the user has cardiovascular disease or not. We used the 3 highest accuracy models: deep learning, SVM and logistical regression models to use as predictors of cardiovascular disease. Using known medical values I also figured out how to provide the best category of health the user would need to work on to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

Cleaned Kaggle database information into usable training data
